// Package scaffold implements `lifecycle init`'s side of the build: it
// authors the managed pointer blocks in agent-instruction files (CLAUDE.md,
// AGENTS.md) and fans the embedded Layer-2 skills out into a repo's
// agent-skill trees, keeping both drift-protected via openspec/.state
// (implementation-plan.md §2.9, §2.12, §5/§6 of the mirrored constitution
// plan).
//
// Copied from adr-sourced-constitution/internal/scaffold (implementation-
// plan.md §2.12, "copy, don't couple") — the managed-block + drift-state
// engine and skill fan-out helper are frozen, generic logic shared in shape
// (not in code) between the two primitives. Only the marker text, the
// .state location, and the config/embedded-skill wiring (left as TODO seams
// for M6/M7 — see scaffold.go) differ from the source.
//
// The managed-block editor here is deliberately byte-precise: it locates a
// block by an exact marker pair, rewrites only the interior, and appends a
// fresh block at EOF when absent — the doctoc/terraform-docs/ansible
// blockinfile pattern (plan §2.2). The marker text is byte-stable across CLI
// versions (a documented ansible-blockinfile failure mode); the `v1` token in
// the markers is the migration hook for a future pointer-strategy change.
